<h1>SIT741 Assignment 1</h1>
<h4>Unit Chair: Wei Luo</h4>
<h4>Due: 12 April 2019</h4>
</section>
<section>
<p><em>Assignment 1 contributes to 25% of your final SIT741 mark. The full mark is 25. It must be completed individually, and submitted to CloudDeakin before the due date: 11 pm, 12/04/2019 (Week 6 Friday).</em></p>
<div id="learning-goals">
<h2>Learning goals</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will work on a real-world problem to consolidate your learning in the first five weeks, including organise your data as tidy data and perform simple statistical analyses. This activity also serves as scaffolding for the upcoming Assignment 2.</p>
<p>Please start early so that you can identify any skill/knowledge gap and seek support from the teaching staff and other students.</p>
<div id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In Australia, we have experienced extreme heat in the year 2019. With the inevitable rise of extreme weather events, it is crucial that we better understand its potential impact on our everyday life.</p>
<p>In November 2016, a storm in Victoria triggered an unexpected surge of emergency department visits at the local public hospitals. Some consequences of this weather event were captured in this news article:</p>
<pre><code><a href="http://bit.ly/2gC8j6U">http://bit.ly/2gC8j6U</a></code></pre>
<p>Apart from such storms, various weather events may affect the demand for care at our emergency departments (EDs). In SIT741, you will use publicly available data to understand the relationship between weather patterns and ED demands. Your analysis could provide crucial knowledge for resource planning at our health care systems.</p>
<p>Assignment 1 will focus on the analysis of ED demand data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="task-1-obtaining-ed-demand-data-4-points">
<h2>Task 1: Obtaining ED demand data (4 points)</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s find data measuring ED demands. We will use the <em>emergency departments admissions and attendances</em> data set provided by the Department of Health of Western Australia:</p>
<pre><code><a href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/emergency-department-admissisons-and-attendances">http://data.gov.au/dataset/emergency-department-admissisons-and-attendances</a></code></pre>
<div id="task-1.1-download-the-data-set-using-the-link-below.">
<h3>Task 1.1 Download the data set using the link below.</h3>
<pre><code><a href="http://bit.ly/2nkCUEh">http://bit.ly/2nkCUEh</a></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="task-1.2-answer-the-following-questions">
<h3>Task 1.2 Answer the following questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>How many rows are in the data?</li>
<li>What data types are in the data?</li>
<li>What time period does the data cover?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;Attendance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Admissions&rdquo;?</li>
<li>What do the variables <code>Tri_1</code>, <code>Tri_2</code>, &hellip; represent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: You may need to consult the relevant background document, for example, the government webpage here: <a href="https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/About-us/Policy-frameworks/Information-Management/Mandatory-requirements/Emergency-Department-and-Emergency-Services-Patient-Level-Data-Collection-and-Reporting">https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/About-us/Policy-frameworks/Information-Management/Mandatory-requirements/Emergency-Department-and-Emergency-Services-Patient-Level-Data-Collection-and-Reporting</a> .</p>

<h2>Task 2: Tidy data (5 points)</h2>
<div id="task-2.1-cleaning-up-columns">
<h3>Task 2.1 Cleaning up columns</h3>
<p>You may notice that the ED csv file has two rows of heading. This is quite common in data generated by BI reporting tools. Let&rsquo;s clean up the column names.</p>
<div id="cb4">
<pre><code><a id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">ed_data_link &lt;- 'govhack3.csv'</a>
<a id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2">top_row &lt;- read_csv(ed_data_link, col_names = FALSE, n_max = 1)</a>
<a id="cb4-3" data-line-number="3">second_row &lt;- read_csv(ed_data_link, n_max = 1)</a>
<a id="cb4-4" data-line-number="4"></a>
<a id="cb4-5" data-line-number="5">column_names &lt;- second_row %&gt;% </a>
<a id="cb4-6" data-line-number="6">  unlist(., use.names=FALSE) %&gt;% </a>
<a id="cb4-7" data-line-number="7">  make.unique(., sep = "__") # double underscore</a>
<a id="cb4-8" data-line-number="8"></a>
<a id="cb4-9" data-line-number="9">column_names[2:8] &lt;- str_c(column_names[2:8], '0', sep='__')</a>
<a id="cb4-10" data-line-number="10"></a>
<a id="cb4-11" data-line-number="11">daily_attendance &lt;- </a>
<a id="cb4-12" data-line-number="12">  read_csv(ed_data_link, skip = 2, col_names = column_names)</a></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now print out a list of healthcare facilities (hospitals) in the data set.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-2.2-tidying-data">
<h3>Task 2.2 Tidying data</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now we have a data frame. Answer the following questions for this data frame.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does each variable have its own column?</li>
<li>Does each observation have its own row?</li>
<li>Does each value have its own cell?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use spreading and/or gathering to transform the data frame into tidy data. The key is to put data from the same measurement source in a column and to put each observation in a row. Please answer the following questions.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How many spreading operations do you need?</li>
<li>How many gathering operations do you need?</li>
<li>Explain the steps.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Are the variables having the expected variable types in R? Clean up the data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any missing values? Fix the missing data. Justify your actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="task-3-exploratory-data-analysis-5-points">
<h2>Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (5 points)</h2>
<p>It is often a good idea to eyeball your data before fitting a model. The purpose is to understand the distribution of different measurements and their relations.</p>
<div id="task-3.1-select-a-hospital">
<h3>Task 3.1 Select a hospital</h3>
<p>Select a hospital and create a data set for only that hospital. Print out the hospital&rsquo;s name, the total number of ED attendances and the total number of admissions.</p>

<h3>Task 3.4 Which distributions are appropriate for modelling the ED demand? Which variables meet the assumptions for the Poisson distribution? (For simplicity, here we will make a &ldquo;naive&rdquo; assumption that counts on consecutive days are independent. We will relax this assumption later in the unit.)</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div id="task-4-fitting-distributions-5-points">
<h2>Task 4: Fitting distributions (5 points)</h2>
<p>As you may see in the previous step, although we are dealing with count data, a Poisson distribution may not provide a good fit. Actually, unconditional Poisson distribution is too restrictive for most real-world applications. In this task, we will fit a couple of distributions to the Triage 1 attendance.</p>
<div id="task-4.1-fitting-distributions">
<h3>Task 4.1: Fitting distributions</h3>
<p>Fit a Poisson distribution and a negative binomial distribution on <code>Tri_1</code>. You may use functions provided by the package <code>fitdistrplus</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-4.2-compare-distributions">
<h3>Task 4.2: Compare distributions</h3>
<p>Compare the log-likelihood of two fitted distributions.</p>
<p>Which distribution fit the data better? Why?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="task-5-research-question-3-points">
<h2>Task 5: Research question (3 points)</h2>
<p>There are more than one ways to fit a distribution to a set of numbers. Produce a short literature review on different distribution fitting methods, showing the pros and cons of each method.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-6-ethics-question-2-points">
<h2>Task 6: Ethics question (2 points)</h2>
<p>During your work, have you identified any issues that have ethical implications? Does it concern security or privacy? How do you mitigate the risk?</p>
</div>
<div id="task-7-reflection-1-point">
<h2>Task 7: Reflection (1 point)</h2>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What help did you receive from other students? What did you learn from them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please estimate the mark that you will receive for assignment 1. Please provide both a point estimate and an interval estimate (a confidence interval). You don&rsquo;t need to provide a mathematical model, but please explain how do you use conditional information to reach the estimates. Based on the conditional information, explain what you would have done differently to improve that mark?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="what-to-submit">
<h2>What to submit</h2>
<p>By the due date, you are required to submit the following files to the assignment Dropbox in CloudDeakin.</p>
<ol>
<li>An MS Word or PDF file containing your answers to all the assignment questions.</li>
